\chapter{Literature review}
\label{ch:chapter03}
This is a targeted literature review. Rather than surveying every source, we screened many papers and selected only those that match our setting of modular ETL, auditable data layers, text classification and continuous learning. After skimming broadly, we extracted concrete design principles and strategies from the most relevant academic work and combined them with actionable guidance from industry case study. The thesis adopts their core ideas where they fit our purpose and adapts patterns when needed, while documenting trade offs. It filters the literature for what we can actually implement and uses it to justify the architectural choices made here. Here is the list of the most relevant literature found and how they influenced the design:
